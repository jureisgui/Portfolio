                <p>I am originally from Brazil and have been living in New Zealand since February 2016. I came here for a career break and ended up staying because of the culture and beautiful sceneries. 
                    <br><br>
                    Most of my adult life has been dedicated to teaching, and it was a career I fell in love with while studying something completely unrelated in university (Social Communications). I pursued my passion for teaching until the notorious burnout caught up with me after a decade. Since then, I found a new passion: coding. I enjoy the challenge and transforming ideas into tangible digital creations.
                    <br><br>
                    I have a good sense of humor and a lot of patience (probably because of my teaching background). I am quite adaptable too, having lived in three culturally distinct countries (USA, Finland, and now NZ) and worked across various industries like education, hospitality, customer service, and now IT. 
                    <br><br>
                    I'm always up for new and exciting experiences! Some of my favorite adventure-filled memories include working at Disney World, deciding to go skydiving on a whim and taking the leap the same day, and braving the winter in Finland. But hey, not all adventures turn out to be a blast! One of my least favorite spur-of-the-moment decisions was bungee jumping, and let me tell you, I was absolutely petrified!
